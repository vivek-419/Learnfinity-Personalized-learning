              Learnfinity is on a mission to transform education through AI-powered personalized learning experiences. We believe that everyone deserves access to high-quality education tailored to their unique learning style, pace, and career goals.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Our Story</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Founded in 2023, Learnfinity began with a simple observation: traditional one-size-fits-all education doesn't work for most people. Our team of educators, engineers, and AI specialists came together to create a learning platform that adapts to each learner rather than forcing learners to adapt to a rigid system.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Our Approach</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              We use advanced AI algorithms to analyze learning patterns, identify knowledge gaps, and create personalized learning paths that evolve as you progress. Our system doesn't just teach contentâ€”it teaches you how to learn more effectively.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Our Values</h2>
            <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Education should be available to everyone, regardless of background or circumstances.</li>
              <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Learning experiences should adapt to the learner, not the other way around.</li>
              <li><strong>Community:</strong> Learning happens best in collaborative environments with peer support.</li>
              <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Our platform gets smarter with every interaction, just like our learners.</li>
            </ul>
